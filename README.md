This is my final year project. The title for my final year project is Clinic Management System. 
This system is to help patient, nurse and doctor to manage their daily work.
From this application, patient can view their history treatment, make an appointment by choose date and available time slot, and patient also can cancel their appointment. Nurse is to manage the clinic stock tools. Moreover, doctor can managage patient treatment by adding, edit and delete the patient's treatment with the visual structure of teeth.
